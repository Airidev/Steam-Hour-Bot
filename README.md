# Steam Idle Booster
### Open Script for Community

This project is in progress at the moment.
the script give to you **Hours** in a lot of games and in the Future creating something like **Card Dropping,** using **HTML Forms**.
I know that already exists a lot of scripts for idle.. But i wanna be different and create my own scripts.

## Let's Beggin

Install the NodeJs from https://nodejs.org/en/
Open your **CMD Prompt**

Use **npm** to install the necessary  modules:

npm install steam-user

npm install fs

npm install readline-sync

npm install request


## Let's Start the bot

Go to **app.json** and change the **username** and the **passowrd**, then you need to enter the game Codes from http://steamcommunity.com/app/730 -> **730** ==  CS:GO

Use **node idlebot.js** to start your bot 


## Trade System

Coming Soon



That's it! your Bot is idling... ;D

Note: There is a game idle limit to Boost your account. Max **30** Games.
